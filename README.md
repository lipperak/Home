# Hi !

I am a second year PhD student in flow mechanics at [LadHyX](https://www.ladhyx.polytechnique.fr/).
(Laboratoire d'Hydrodynamique de l'Ecole Polytechnique) under the supervison of 
[Sébastien Michelin](http://www.off-ladhyx.polytechnique.fr/people/michelin/Site/Home.html) and 
[Michael Benzaquen](http://www.off-ladhyx.polytechnique.fr/people/benzaquen/).

My research focuses mainly on **hydrodynamics at small length scales** (micron-size) and especially on the behavior of single and collective self-propelled particles. Thoses systems are good candidates as biomimetic alternatives to biological microorganisms in addition to potential device for controlled applications in the field of biomedical engineering (drug-delivery).
 
Before I had plunged into the low-Reynolds fluid dynamics field of research I graduated from
the Mechanical Engineering Department of Ecole des Ponts et Chaussées ([GMM](http://www.enpc.fr/genie-mecanique-et-materiaux)) and from Advanced Aeronautical Engineering Master of Sciences at Imperial College of London ([AAE](http://www.imperial.ac.uk/aeronautics)). 
 
Finally, I discovered the fascinating and thrilling world of research thanks to [Thierry Ondarçuhu](https://www.imft.fr/ONDARCUHU-Thierry) through a project on wetting phenomenon at the nano-scale.
