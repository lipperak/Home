# Hi !

I am a second year PhD student in flow mechanics at [LadHyX](https://www.ladhyx.polytechnique.fr/).
(Laboratoire d'Hydrodynamique de l'Ecole Polytechnique) under the supervison of 
[Sébastien Michelin](http://www.off-ladhyx.polytechnique.fr/people/michelin/Site/Home.html) and 
[Michael Benzaquen](http://www.off-ladhyx.polytechnique.fr/people/benzaquen/).

My research focuses mainly on **hydrodynamics at small length scales** (micron-size) and especially on the behavior of single and collective
 self-propelled particles that are good candidates as biomimetic alternatives to biological microorganisms.
 
Before I had plunged into the low-Reynolds hydrodynamics world I graduated from
the Mechanical Engineering Department at Ecole des Ponts et Chaussées and from Advanced Aeronautical
Engineering Master of Sciences at Imperial College of London. 
 
Finally, I discovered the fascinating and thrilling world of reasearch thanks to [Thierry Ondarçuhu](https://www.imft.fr/ONDARCUHU-Thierry) through 
a project on wetting phenomenon at the nano-scale.
