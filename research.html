In recent years, self-propelled catalytic particles have attracted much attention as biomimetic alternatives to biological microorganisms, in order to study individual and collective dynamics at the micron scale. They are also potential candidates to perform
controlled applications in the field of biomedical engineering (e.g. targeted drug delivery or microsurgery) or to actively control the macroscopic behavior of a synthetic suspension.

<br>Generically, these systems rely on a chemical activity of their surface
(namely the ability to change the physico-chemical properties of their environment such as temperature orsolute content)
and surface mobility that generate a surface slip velocity or stress forcing in response to local thermodynamic gradients
(e.g. phoretic mobility or Marangoni stress). Examples of such phoretic systems are bi-metallic catalytic swimmers 
or reactive droplets, that release a solute in their environment.
<br> Most of these systems are not neutrally-buoyant and evolve next to a boundary (i.e. wall or free surface). Yet most of the existing models focus on individual and collective modeling in bulk (i.e. far from these surfaces). 
This project will therefore focus on the role of confining boundaries in setting individual particles' locomotion properties as well as their interactions	</p>

        Active droplets swim in a viscous fluid
        thanks to the Marangoni flows forced
        at their surface by self-generated
        gradients of a chemical solute
        produced by the droplets. Each
        swimming droplet modifies the
        solute content and flow field seen
        by its neighbours. This project studies
        the competition of these two routes of
        interaction, as well as the exact interaction
        of active droplets with confining
        boundaries

        <h3>Propulsion of micro particles in low-Reynolds flows  </h3>
	 <p style="text-align:justify;">
	In order to propel in a Stokes flow, a micro-particle has to break somewhere a symmetry. 
	 We could think about E.Coli bacteria whose helicoïdal flagellum enables it to perform non revertible in time motions and leads to its propulsion. 
	 <br> In this project we focus on the impact of slight deviation from a homogeneous sphere that evolves in low-Reynolds (but non zero) flows. </p>
